   Alex:  Hello, everyone, I hope you had a good day today at Strangeloop. 
   [cheers]
   [applause]
   >> It's been a fantastic day and it's been great seeing everybody. And before I introduce our keynote, I wanted to mention that tonight are the unsessions, back at Union Station. Those are from 7 to 10 and those are in four of the sort of train meeting rooms that are if you go past the registration -- or the check-in desk to the left and then all the way back, New York central, Illinois Central Frisco Burlington and the other one that I'm blanking. And the schedule for that is also on the website and also on Guidebook and that should be up to date. One thing for anybody who is staying at the Hilton Ballpark, the overflow hotel, there will be a shuttle that goes from Union Station back to Hilton Ballpark at a little after 10, so they'll probably leave at like 10:15 or something like that and it will be right out front of the Union Station hotel and this is not like a shuttle like last night. It's just a one time taking back to the hotel after the unsessions. So feel free to take advantage of that. There will be pa person out there that you can take to. I also wanted to take this opportunity to thank the other Strangeloop organizers. I know that I'm the sort of more visible face for most of Strangeloop. There are several other organizers who spent an enormous amount of time throughout the year, working on things, Bridget Hilyer, Nick Cowan, Ryan Senior and Mario. I couldn't do this without them, so ...
   [applause]
   >> So big thanks to those guys. And Bridget. So for this -- for today's final session, obviously this -- we had a -- this incident of the Michael Brown shooting last year, last August here in town, and all the subsequent events in Ferguson and it was really something that a lot of people are still dealing with. It's certainly something that caused me to -- if anybody saw Gary Bernhardt's talk about ideology -- it caused me to challenge many assumptions that I have about the world and some privileges that I have so I looked for some place that I could do something and ran across a program that our speaker had started to give opportunities to youth in Ferguson. And I was thought that was really awesome and I was really happy to support that and as I started planning the program for this year, a few months later, I got to know more about her and thought she would bring something to this conference that people might not get anywhere else. So I'm really excited for you to share her story, I'm not going to share it because she's going to tell you a lot more about it, so this is our final keynote so she will talk to you more about her name. It's part of the presentation.
   >> Yes.

   So hello, everyone. Welcome, my name is Idalin Bobe, and I'm a technologist at ThoughtWorks. I'm super passionate about social justice and technology and have been pursuing this initiative for six years. And I'm very humbled and grateful to be here today, just to share my story, to say where I come from, and to speak on the story of Ferguson and how you can get involved. So definitely thank you, Alex Miller and Strangeloop for having me, because to have an Afro-Latina, someone who's black and Puerto Rican could be here and to speaking about you and a woman is very powerful at a tech conference. So shout out to you all. Thank you.
   Before we get started, I wanted to feel the room out by a quick survey. So I have some questions I'm going to ask. If any of these questions pertain to you and there's a yes, just raise your hand and after each question we'll put our hands down. Cool with y'all?
   So raise your hand if you went to college.
   Whoa, and that's a lot of hands, awesome, down. Raise your hands if your parents went to college.
   Raise your hand if you have ever been harassed or targeted by the police.
   Raise your hand if you had a computer in your home growing up.
   Raise your hand if you had ever had to change your birth name to get a job.
   Raise your hand if you know what tech activism is.
   Raise your hand if you know where Ferguson, Missouri is.
   Thank you for participating in that. In these next stories that I will share, I'll provide more context to those questions. So to me tech activism is the intersection where technologists and community organizers meet and they knowledge-share and they create tools and programs and solutions to protect oppressed communities. I was inspired to talk to you today about tech activism due to all the civil unrest going on around the world. As you noticed there have been more protests, organized resistance and uprisings occurring in response to increased police brutality against oppressed communities.
   Now, more than ever, millions of people across demographics and communities all over the world are rising up together, they're rising up to resist exploitation. They're rising up to resist racism. They're rising up to resist state terrorism.
   Topics that we'll discuss today include what is our role as technologists in activism, how is technology both helping and hindering the effectiveness of activism and more importantly, how do we hold each other, in this room, how do we hold each other accountable to bringing our wisdom, knowledge and resources to the table to really push the narrative and to push the needle of social justice within our communities? As I share my personal story of how I broke into the tech industry, I wanted to start off with the story of my name.
   Many people know me as Abby. Even on my Twitter handle, I use Abby Bobe, but Abby is not my name. It's not my middle name. It has nothing to do with my name. My name is Idalin. Idalin Bobe, and as a kid growing up, a lot of my nonLatino teachers always had a problem saying my name and many times I was humiliated and embarrassed by this and I would always go home and feel from frustrated that I got made fun of again because people didn't know my name and oftentimes teachers wouldn't call on me because they were embarrassed to say my name. So my older brother created the name Abby. He was like, it's a very amazing name, less intimidating, everyone loves Abby and I definitely took on that name and for my entire life I've been using and going by Abby. However, when I graduated college I wanted the professional world to know me as Idalin and I put on my cover letters and resumes Idalin Bobe and I sent everything out and I didn't get anything back. It was weird because I was very proud of my accomplishments because I was like I should at least get a first phone interview, something. But I was thinking, people have been embarrassed and intimidated by my name so I wondered if that was the case so I changed my name on my resume to Abby Bobe, and Abby received lots of opportunities, Abby received phone calls and interviews and just e-mail responses and I received my job as Abby Bobe. So I again took on the name as Abby Bobe, but today as I stand before you as a 31-year-old woman, I want to use my name, Idalin. Idalin is tied to my culture. My grandmother named me. It connects me to who I am, to my mother. But I understand that some cultures, in the times that we live, are more often valued than others.
   I'm from North Philly. Born and raised and the playground is where I spent most of my days. Anyone who's from Philly can sing along and I carry the culture of my family and my neighborhood everywhere I go. I'm very proud to have grown up in a black and Puerto Rican family. I'm from the neighborhood called Badlands in North Philadelphia. It's in the zip code 19133. It's the poorest zip code in Philadelphia where factories and booming businesses once stood, empty lots and abandoned buildings, boarded up houses now occupy where I live. These are actually screenshots outside my mother's house. This is how my house and my neighborhood looks right now.
   And in the last two years Philadelphia closed 23 of its public schools.
   This public high school, I attended a school named Thomas Edison and we had a 75% dropout rate. This meant my freshman year kind of looked just like this. My freshman year we started school and it was 1200 students and they brought us to an auditorium on day one and they told us look to the left and look to the right, by 10th grade, one of you won't be here. We graduated 287 students. We had more substitute teachers than actual teachers. We barely had textbooks and you were forced to encounter and just be around the police all the time in order to get into the school you had to go to metal detectors and you had to be patted down and in my neighborhood the police were always circling, which was odd, because growing up, we knew if you called the police, they wouldn't come to your neighborhood to help you, but you seen them in the street and you were always being harassed by them. So it was really interesting.
   Most students never even had the opportunity to speak to a guidance counselor, so college was never in the question of many of our students. But fortunately for me, there was this pastor. His name was Pastor Melvin Jenkins and he attended and was a professor at Indiana University at Pennsylvania. It's near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and he would go into the inner cities of Philadelphia, to the worst schools and pick about 30 students he saw potential in. So a student like myself, he pulled up my grades and like, Abby, on paper, you're like the worst student. But if someone looked at you in a magnifying glass, they would see you were so passionate, you were so persistent, you have so much determination, because I went to school, I had a job, and I worked about like 30 hours a week, I took care of my family. I helped my sisters and my brothers all the time. A lot of people my age didn't even do as much as I did. But on paper, I sucked. I had about like a 50% attendance rate.
   And this program that he would put us in was called the Philadelphia partnership program, and in in this program it gave students like me a second chance to go to college. The program wouldn't look at your SAT scores or your GPA which was awesome because as a senior I didn't even know what a GPA was so I graduated, I was the first to graduate in my family to go beyond middle school, high school and then college in my family which was quite an accomplishment and I did terrible my first year and I it wasn't your typical like, oh, I was partying my freshman year and got too drunk and couldn't go to class but more was like when I went to class I didn't understand what the professors were saying. It was like I was in Charlie Brown's teachers class and she was like wah, wah, wah and it was like what was this man or lady saying? And I called my mom and I said I wanted to drop out. Not because I couldn't just understand but even when I went to the professors and told them hey I'm having a hard time understanding class, by the time they understood how far behind I was, one of my professors told me to drop out and go to middle school. And probably I would have a chance at just learning what we're going through in college. I went to study guide sessions which other students and people were like, you know, if you could not come to our study sessions, because you're very disruptive, because you're so far behind, you keep us behind. So I told my mom, I'm dropping out, I tried, and she was like, well, what do they have that you don't? Why are they succeeding and you're failing and I told her, I mean I go to school and then I work. And after work I come home late at night, and it's too late to walk to a computer lab, but other students, if they go into their rooms, they have their computers and laptops, I didn't have one. So my mom was amazing and she crowd funded my first laptop which back then wasn't called crowd funding, it was like knocking on people's doors and like, hey, my daughter needs a laptop, can you donate and together with my relatives they gave me my first laptop. With my first laptop it was like the whole world was in my hands. .
   I had access to all these YouTube tutorials. I went to Ask Jeeves a lot, so like our keynote speaker this morning was talking about, I went to Ask Jeeves and Ask Jeeves actually helped me out because at times when I was embarrassed to ask things that I didn't know, I went to Ask Jeeves and I asked him everything, it was A plus B equals C? And without judgment, I was able to get tutorials and just learn and through collective learning with online contributors, from freshman year, not knowing what a number line was, I was able to graduate with 3.75 in applied statistics. Which I thought was pretty dope.
   [applause]
   I ended up graduating college with a marketing degree and applied statistics really because I wanted to change the stories and the content and the narrative being fed into people in my community and to youth in my high school, and I wanted to challenge the statistics because honestly, still to today, where do they survey these people at? They never go to my hood and survey us, so I've always been interested in challenging the statistics that's out there about blacks and Puerto Ricans. When I graduated college I had a full-time offer at a corporate job. I was doing marketing Analytics at a food I was making more than my mom, dad and grand mom combined. Even though it wasn't a lot. It was only 50,000 to me it was like baller alert and I was able to help my family with a whole bunch of stuff not only that I was in a leader position in their diversity events and I managed their nonprofit and with our nonprofit we were able to deNate a million dollars to all the other nonprofits around the area. And I thought this was amazing but after my third year of doing it felt like I was passing out Band-Aids to my community like oh, here's a Band-Aid about diversity and although this nonprofit is struggling with homelessness, here is a thousand dollars. And it didn't feel right. I was thinking and reflecting in my life like what happened in my life that changed my trajectory and how can I bring that same impact to other people's lives and to me it was the power of a laptop so I wept went on Google because then Ask Jeeves wasn't as cool and I went on Google and I was like how do I get into the tech industry and where is it? And seriously.
   [laughter]
   I found out Google that the technology industry was booming in Silicon Valley and I was like, boom, I'm going there and my mom was like you're crazy, you have a great job. It's 2009 it's the great recession, why would you leave your job to go into an industry you have no experience in and I told her, don't worry, mom, I got this, because this is bigger than me and I packed my car, not with clothes, but a year of food supplies because I told her at least I wouldn't starve as I'm out in my mission and I literally had a 30-pound bag of rice and goya beans and if you're Puerto Rican you know goya is you live and by die by it. I did struggle I had to couch surf and was a little homeless throughout my first year and then applied and got into an MBA program. In Oakland California at Mills College and I studied social impact and in this program I was able to also study computer science.  no, I never knew I knew how to code this. I thought this was something you know, other people did and when I was in my class I had a professor she was an MIT, she did her MIT master's any mean computer science masters at MIT and she was super badass and she was very disciplined and I ended up being the second best in the class which I thought was amazing because once again I didn't know I could do this because I didn't have the opportunity through these education programs and together with my MBA and with computer science, I thought, hey, I could create a proposal and I submitted the proposal to the global case competition, where I wanted to introduce human-centered design, tech training courses, to communities that needed it the most and together really just end poverty. Now, I didn't win the competition, but there was an elder in the crowd and he was from India, south India and he was like, you know, I really like your idea. What if I allow you to go to south India to my school, which served the lowest caste system and launch your pilot program? And that I did. I raised the money and and got some donated laptops and I went to India and in India I worked with 80 students from kindergarten to 8th grade and with 20 women and they were teachers and together we created a program where we taught computer applications, so just regular Microsoft, 'em heh Excel, applications like that and it was a pretty dope program. At the same time I met the founder of black girls code. Kimberly Bryant. Now, it's a nonprofit organization educating young girls of color, black, Latina and Native American in computer programming, their goal is to have a million girls of color learn code so they can create and not just consume tech tools and it was amazing. I went to Kimberly and I was like, hey, your mission is exactbly what I want to do in life. Can you join my team and she was like sure, I have no money so if you're willing to do it for free, we could change the world. And I was like badass, I'm right with you. And in 2011 we worked with 15 girls and two years later we served over 2,000 girls in our program. We worked in ten states around the United States and Johannesburg South Africa, and it was amazing as well as it was challenging, because Kimberly was a single mother and I was in grad school so not being funded was a real struggle and we did have meetings with funders, but people often said if we change black, if we took out black from Black Girls Code, probably then they would donate to us and we thought, no, we knew black girls code was an affirmation, it was an affirmation to the world that black girls could do so much more than the opportunities and resources that we were given.
   At the end of 20 # 13, or the middle of 2013, George Zimmerman was found not guilty for murdering Trayvon Martin. I don't know about you, but I felt like my brother passed away and I felt there was no justice for him, and I felt very just sad and I was actually borderline on in depression and I changed all of my social media to black and I cried for many days and I just felt this overwhelming pressure that I wasn't doing enough in the world, that I left Philadelphia to come to Silicon Valley and still, kids like Trayvon Martin, they don't have the opportunity to dream, they don't have the opportunity and I wanted to do more, so I left Black Girls Code because I wanted to do more with social justice and technology, and in the winter of 2014, the founders of yes, we code and Qeyno labs came to me and said hey, we're doing a social justice hackathon, would you like to be a part of it and at first I Hess itated but then their tag line was, what if an app could have saved Trayvon Martin. And I was like whoa, badass, I'm there, I'm definitely there with y'all. We ended up starting three social justice hackathon. And I remember telling a friend I even want to go deeper with this because I now was aware of government mass surveillance and I was now aware of the systems that control and oppress people of color and I thought technology, if used the right way could start a revolution. And my friend was like, you know, you could be arrested for that and I was like, yeah, you know, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. That brings me to ThoughtWorks. ThoughtWorks, in case you don't know is a global IT consulting firm filled with socially conscious coders who are passionate about technology, as well as using tech to solve social problems. Now, I felt this would be a great opportunity for me to knowledge share and learn from the best technologists in the world and then afterwards, go home and work on social justice projects and ThoughtWorks wasn't a stranger to me, I'd worked with ThoughtWorks throughout my career in Black Girls Code, yes, we code and Qeyno labs. And in August 2014 is when I officially joined and did my first project. That weekend I went on social media as I always do. I'm one eye open on social media, and my friends sent me this, this picture, it said Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son.
   And I felt like once again there was salt being added to my wounds and I felt heart broken over it and I kept following the social media of feeds and through social media I learned who Michael Brown was. Michael Brown was 18, he was unarmed and he was going to start college. When Ferguson office shot him ten times. I learned thousand social media that Michael brown's body lied on the streets in the middle of a community apartment complex for 4 and a half hours, uncovered.
   Now, this, this happened during a time in America where people of color, black and Latino, we were experiencing so many deaths in the black and brown community that we couldn't even go to work feeling like ourselves. And in the same summer, Eric Gardner was put in a choke hold and murdered by NYPD for selling loose cigarettes, untaxed loose cigarettes and on video you can hear him pleading, I can't breathe. I can't breathe. And that summer, I couldn't breathe. When Michael Brown died beings, I couldn't breathe. When Eric Gardner died, couldn't breathe. And as a person of color in America, I had enough. According to the Malcolm X grassroots movement, every 28 hours, a black person in America is killed by a police officer or vigilante and according to Rosa clementae who is a very strong activist in this movement she add if you add Latinos or undocumented immigrants, this number might jump to every few hours. And I had enough and I went on social media. I created a Facebook post and an e-mail and I blasted it out to every technologist I knew in San Francisco and I said if you you are a technologist and if you give a fuck about black people, if you give a fuck about Latino people, about oppressed people about everything we're going through, about Michael Brown, I need you to meet me at ThoughtWorks office in San Francisco.
   During the same time that I put my post out, TefPOO tweeted out on August 9th, basically marshal law is taking place in Ferguson. All perimeters blocked coming and going. National and international friends, help.
   Through the power of social media, this won't be swept under the rug. We are about to expose Ferguson Police Department, we want answers. Last post, I'm here to tell you that Ferguson PD is a bunch of liars from the pit of hell, an entire community saw what really happened.
   And without me knowing, ThoughtWorks actually sent a team of technologists to Ferguson to help on the ground.
   Now, before we start talking about Ferguson, I really want to provide some context, because unlike if you're anything like me, I didn't know where Ferguson was. The media made it seem like Ferguson was like this small little place in Missouri, like far far away, and no one can get to it and this isolated place.
   So I put up this map. Because this entire thing is St. Louis county and Ferguson is St. Louis county and activists everywhere wanted everyone to know, Ferguson was not isolated. Ferguson was St. Louis and the cop culture in Ferguson was the same culture all over St. Louis and city.
   >> Despite making up 67% of the population, African Americans accounted for 85% of traffic stops, 993% of arrests. Some examples of the unjust arrests include once a black woman was arrested twice, spent 6 days in jail and paid $5 50 all because she parked her car illegally in 2007. Another harsh citation was people in Ferguson had to pay $531 fine for having their grass too high. That's pretty unfair. According to the Department of Justice report, Ferguson police and court officials were focused on generating revenue from Ferguson fines. In one quarter they made over $17,000 than any other quarter. Now, this is the kicker, Ferguson is only one of 92 municipalities in St. Louis county. Seriously if you're in Ferguson, you cross the street you're in another municipality so you're always being harassed and how Ferguson is set up is broken up, it's very segregated. One part is white, one part is black. On south fleurescent with the Ferguson Police Department that's the white part of town and west Ferguson where Michael Brown was shot and murdered is your black town and if you understand that before going into the story of Michael Brown, then you can understand why people in St. Louis demanded answers. They were sick and tired of being harassed and they wanted to know why was Michael Brown murdered? Why did he deserve to die? But instead of providing the people with answers they used tear gas, brought dogs and militarized police to silence the people.
   People who had their hands up and was walking around with signs at most that they did was block the streets or go to Ferguson Police Department and demand answers the conversation on Twitter moved from why did Mike Brown deserve to die, why was he murdered? To why are we using militarized police and why are they abusing people?
   >> Seeing the community of Ferguson standing up to the powers of be in the name of justice and humanity was breathtaking, it was inspiring and started what is referred to as the Ferguson uprising.
   Now, when thought workers came down and started working with the people on the ground in Ferguson, they the started working with the nonprofit or organization called hands up united. Although it was able to amplify the message of what was going on, the people of Ferguson needed something more sustainable to really bring in the help that they were trying to attract and together, with the direction of activists on the ground, thought work supported activists and built this website, hands up united.org and it was a tool to capture blogs, to capture the voices of people on the ground to raise money for being that were getting arrested and to especially had as a total communication and organizing tool.
   Now, hands up united is an organization created from the Ferguson uprising and includes Rica, TefPoe Tara and ... the platform hands up united was used to for example, to share action details. There were over 100 actions people posted all over the world, to support Ferguson and Mike Brown. We actually created a tool to report police brutality. Not just police killings, because we knew that everyday citizens went there you a lot more police brutality than what was being reported and we wanted to use this data to show the misuse of power by the police.
   >> What we noticed while creating this online platform and connecting with people on social media is that although Ferguson was a small suburb of St. Louis, the world resonated with it. Palestine, Mexico, Egypt, Brazil, Philly, Oakland, LA, New York, Baltimore resonated. Ferguson connected the dots and one thing, with this was that people all over the world was able to see all the oppression done to people of color and on poor people and we were able to see what it felt like to be oppressed in the United States.
   Now, social media was just one way technology was used in the movement. I wanted to highlight other ways we used technology in the movement, laptops, phones, data, social media, hashtags, livestream, donation websites, encryption text, e-mail websites and music. Now, through the end of September to December St. Louis changed. What worked before no longer worked. The technology that we once used to protect the people by lifting up their stories were being compromised and nearly every tool that activists used were being used against them. I'll list this here and I wanted to just highlight some examples. 
   For phones, one of the hands up united team members had a police officer put a gun to her head requested and demanded her phone and the password to get access into her phone.
   Her data was deleted. On social media, we had people who would Toyota out accounts and tweet out what was going on, their accounts were suspended. And one time, and a couple times, hashtags that we would use, if you went to the search engine where on social media it is, and just put search the hashtag that we were all using, you couldn't even find it, so they were being filtered. Our streams streams that we used to protect us against police would go online just publicly automatically and police officers were using that against us in court:
   Donation websites were hacked. Our emails were reviewed and how we knew that was because Ferguson Police Department created a letter and shared it amongst themselves saying that they reviewed text messages and emails and we found the letter and you know, that's just one way that the use of tech wras being compromised.
   As we got closer to the Grand Jury decision, 100FBI agents were in St. Louis, meaning all that we couldn't see and figure out other ways that the government and the powers that be was using tech against us, we were being surveillanced. And police during this time were becoming extremely aggressive, with targeting community organizers. No longer would you just go out at night to protest against them and be arrested, but during this time, right here, this is a 19-year-old young lady from lost voices, for 45 days, she protested and she stood and encampments to protest Michael Brown or Darren Wilson and one day they called me and they're like yo, Ab, there's mad police officers over here we need you to come over here and see what's going on so that's me right there circled with my camera. I was arrested that day for filming, and arrested. I got charged for interfering with police, disobeying and officer and resisting arrest.  Again, police, the state and the powers that be were using technology to silence us and abs the cameras disappeared, the police officers, they grew more aggressive and they started targeting lots of community organizers.
   We desperately needed a shift from just people tweeting all the time to actually using technology to help protect the people on the ground.
   Social media was good at amplifying the message but as Astra Taylor author of the people's platform taking back power and culture in the digital age stated do not be misled by digital metrics. Because although we had a thousand retweets, that didn't protect the people and didn't always mean that it helped with pushing the agenda and what would he we wanted in the movement forward.
   Ferguson allowed and revealed a lot about what was going on in America. It revealed issues of power, privilege, race and class, and this is something the technology community has to struggle with, because right now automation and technology is impacting every aspect of the world. So these things, they affect everyone here and we're either helping or hurting the people that it's affecting.
   Entire communities are being left behind, unable to access resources and opportunities, because of systemic barriers. This is what we must work together to change.
   And November, 2014, I decided I wasn't leaving Ferguson, and although I was supposed to go back to ThoughtWorks and start another project, I decided that was moral a decision for me to stay behind and protect the people, because not only were people being physically attacked, there was the powers that be that was just using technology to really oppress them and I wanted to do something about it.
   >>
   >> So I decided I would help hands up united start a tech program. So if you can imagine what would a tech program look like if the black panthers launched one, that's the type of program I wanted to launch and we wanted to help, with this program we really wanted to help local activists use and understand technology so they could protect their people and really just empower them to continue the movement going, so I often use the term taking the revolution to the cloud. And I launched a crowd funded campaign and my goal was to launch $10,000 in ten days and if I could do that, I felt confident that I could really take that money and kind of leverage it and at the end of ten days, not only did I raise 10,000, I raised 10,000 and had organizations like ThoughtWorks who donated 30 laptops so we could start our own computer lab here in Ferguson, Missouri, which was amazing. We named the program Roy Clay, Sr.. He was born in Ferguson and considered to be the black God farther of Silicon Valley as a teen, he, too, was harassed by Ferguson police. One day after work it was 5:10 he wanted tock to the store and get a soda and Ferguson police pulled him over, snapped him up, threw him to in a car and drove him to a body of water. He thought he was going die that day and they let him go and they were like, nigger, never come back here. All he did was be outside at 5:10. Back then if you were a black person you could not be outside in Ferguson past 5 p.m. But he continued his studies and was amongst the first black student to go and graduate from St. Louis university. When he graduated employers told him, we don't hire professional negroes. So he had to get a job as a teacher. That still didn't stop him. He kept learning about more math and computers and doing a whole bunch of stuff until he got an opportunity to go to California and in that -- and in California, he was able to create and work with HP to create their first laptop.
   So the name Roy Clay, Sr. is really an affirmation. His name equals resistance, perseverance, dedication and is what we wanted our students to look up, because they could see him. He was from Ferguson, he was black, he came from the same struggles that they went to and they could relate to it, so the goals of the Roy clay senior is to create a workshop that focuses on particular skill sets. we wanted them to focus on political and social awareness to have a clear understanding of what is the digital divide? Why and how did their communities are in properties and others aren't. We wanted them to understand problem solving and everything they learned, we wanted them to apply it to the community and our goal of the program is to create community-driven and socially aware technologists. Most of our students were front line activists or had a relative in the movement. Our first workshop, we focused on web development and we focused on web development because back in October, students wanted to boycott large corporations and really uplift and empower and strengthen black and brown businesses and they wanted to create a database of these businesses, but these stores didn't have a web presence. So we thought it would be a perfect opportunity to combine technology and really just solve that issue:
   Students learned basic web development languages, open source, and created websites for ten local businesses. The program is a building block for additional programs because if you can build confidence that you can use technology and you've seen yourself using technology to solve some type of issue in your community, you will want to continue learning more.
   In the fall and winter of this year, we'll be launching a JavaScript and graphic design workshop. Students in the, wouldshop not only leave the program feeling more empowered, they have marketable skill sets that they can use to get a job and have a clear understanding of how technology is impacting their community.
   To date we graduated 20 students in our program. At the end of the workshop, students receive a $500 stipend and a laptop to continue their work. There's a huge, huge demand for our program. To date we had over 77 people apply to our program and two schools in the Ferguson area asked if we could help launch a tech program in their area. The only reason why we worked with 20 students is because everything we're doing is crowd funded and it costs about $2,000 per student to be in the program.
   Meet Ned. Ned is a front line activist who has been super excited to learn about technology. Ever since I landed in Ferguson in September he would ask me, like yo AB, can you teach me how to code? If you don't know Ferguson burger bar, definitely go out and check it out during your stay in St. Louis. Ned also received an internship opportunity to build the website for Grammy artists, India RE. Ned is currently a mentor for our other programs and is heavily involved with the Roy clay senior program.
   So why is it important to include tech training in the movement?
   >> Now, besides the fact that police, the government and other powers are using technology to oppress people and are using technology to protect their data and to secure what they're doing, it is important. We as a technologists, think about challenging ourselves to be more socially aware and learn our resources, knowledge and wisdom to do something bigger for the people who do not have access to resources. I believe 21st Century activists need 21st Century skill sets. I believe now is the time to educate the people on the ground in neighborhoods like Ferguson, like Philadelphia, and oppressed communities all over the world on how to create technology, not simply use it. Now is the time to recognize all the power we carry in these rooms. Because I believe you all have magic powers, and I believe that we together can collaborate to move the needle forward.
   I challenge everyone in this room to really reflect on the impact you're having on society. I know as a technologist we get caught up in the term revolutionary. Who's here heard of we're creating revolution technology? Anyone? I believe the term revolutionary should only be used when we're creating something for the people, for people who don't have access, for oppress the people. I know we get hyped on our inventions but most of the time we're creating automated and capitalistic technology, it's not revolutionary. Most of the times we're creating technology that is creating a bigger divide in the world, a bigger wealth gap, bigger achievement gaps, bigger opportunity gaps. I know there are tons of online education materials people can find. And I hear that all the time. When I say hey, let's create tech resources together and people are like we could create this curriculum and put it online but let's be realistic, 50% of the people in the world don't even have access to the internet. So who are we creating these tools online for?
   >> If we're not creating it for the people who need it, why put it online and why can't we just get out of our comfort and actually go to the communities that need it and create something solid, something sustainable for them. So I'm asking you to get and challenge any delusions we may have in order to help people on the ground. So what can you do? I say research. Research how tech is being used to oppress people. Research the systematic barriers, research other organizations, connect with organizations like hand up united. Connect with organizations like the dream defenders, these are two organizations that are doing a lost work in their community and they understand the power of technology and they want to get involved, they want to meet you at that intersection. I say schedule tech sessions for local organizations in your neighborhood, go back to your company and say, let's have a tech night where we invite community members to learn the tools that we know so that they could solve problems in their own communities.
   You can do stuff like donate to the Roy clay senior tech program and get in contact with her. Tara Thompson who lives here who's born and raised in St. Louis and runs the tech program with hands up united. She is a ...

   So I definitely want to thank you. Thank you so much for listening me. Contact Tara. Contact me. I would definitely be happy to leave here and know that I inspired someone to reach out to me so that we can collaborate. And before we leave, I wanted us to do a chant. And this chant is to really to inspire us to hone in our duties and to hold us accountable. So I'm going to read off a line and then you'll repeat it. Cool? Cool. It is our duty to fight for freedom.
   >> It is our duty to fight for freedom.
   >> It is our duty to win.
   >> It is our duty to win.
   >> We must love and protect one another.
   >> We must love and protect one another.
   >> We have nothing to lose but our chains.
   >> We have nothing to lose but our chains.
   >> So I want to do that one more time because I felt people were sleeping.
   [laughter]
